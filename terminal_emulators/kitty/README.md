# Kitty

Kitty is a terminal alternative for OSX and Linux. 

It has several features that are missing in Terminal.app and additionally it uses GPU-rendering which is supposed to make the terminal "smoother". It also can be entirely configured using a conf file which makes it easy to transfer
preferences between machines.

Currently I'm exploring switching to kitty from the Terminal.app and Gnome Terminal, this page will contain my notes on that process.

## Create or copy kitty.conf

You can either create `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf` or copy one over. You can edit the file as usual, see the kitty documentation for details. 

After making edits to `kitty.conf` use `ctrl+shift+f5` to reload the config and have those changes reflected. `ctrl+shift+f2` is a shortcut for opening the kitty.conf from anywhere (might want to ensure you have set the `editor` parameter to your preferred editor first though).

## Add syntax highlighting for kitty.conf

## Add a theme
A bunch of themes can be found [here](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty-themes)
