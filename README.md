# devbox-handbook
Personal documentation on setting up my preferred dev environment

For now it will be pretty focused on unix based machines.

## Start From Scratch:

1. [Pick a Terminal Emulator](terminal_emulators)
2. [Set up starship prompt](starship)

## TO-DO:

- Look into oh-my-zsh
    - Look into zsh-syntax-highlighting plugin
- Update kitty docs
- Set up starship prompt repo with custom kitten?
    - Extend custom kitten by figuring out how to make a UI for it.
