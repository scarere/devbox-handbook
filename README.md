Personal documentation on setting up my preferred dev environment

For now it will be pretty focused on unix based machines.

## Start From Scratch:

1. [Pick a Terminal Emulator](terminal_emulators)
2. [Set up starship prompt](starship)

## TO-DO:

- Look into [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh)
    - Look into [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/tree/master) plugin
- Update kitty docs
- Set up starship prompt repo with custom kitten?
    - Extend custom kitten by figuring out how to make a UI for it.
